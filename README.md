# Reporthourbyhour
This code was a intention to implement in my work. I was testing an electronic boards and I had to record the hour by hour, serial number of the board, the name of employee and date. I tried to automatize that but well I would learn more about programming.
For install you can use the command "pip install pyinstaller".
The you can run the next command "pyinstaller file.py" for generate the executable if you code in windows.
You should change the directory (path where the log is saved) in the code and then you should compile it.
